									On 1925, this school was established as “David De SIlva Secondary Junior School”. Then it was transformed as, “David De Silva COllege” and in 1985.
								</p>

								<p>
									Mrs. M J De Silva Hamine was the first Principal. On 13th February 1985, it was advanced as a Second Grade School. It had been a mixed school up to present. Since then, it had obtained successful results and achievements in both educational as well as in the extra-curricular activities. On 25th May 1993, it was upgraded to the national level.

In Ordinary Level Section, students can select their scope of learning in  Agriculture, Information Technology, Commerce or Arts streams.
